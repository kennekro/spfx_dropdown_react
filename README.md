## spfx-dropdown

This is an example of a simple dropdown web part created using React in SharePoint Framework. The web part heavily utilizes the react-dropdown component (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dropdown). 

### Building the code

```
git clone the repo
npm install
gulp serve
```

Running gulp serve will start a local SharePoint Online workbench which can be used to add the Custom Dropdown web part. Everytime you make changes to the code, the workbench will update and display the latest changes.
